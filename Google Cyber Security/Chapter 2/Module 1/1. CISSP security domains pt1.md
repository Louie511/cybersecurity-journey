This lecture focuses on the first four of the eight security domains identified by CISSP, which security teams use to organize tasks, identify gaps, and establish their security posture.

## Security and Risk Management

- This domain involves defining security goals, mitigating risks, ensuring compliance with policies and regulations, and establishing business continuity plans.
- It also emphasizes adhering to legal regulations and ethical behavior to prevent negligence, abuse, or fraud.

## Asset Security

- This domain focuses on protecting both digital and physical assets throughout their lifecycle, including storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction.
- It highlights the importance of knowing what data an organization possesses and who has access to it to maintain a strong security posture.

## Security Architecture and Engineering

- This domain aims to optimize data security by implementing effective tools, systems, and processes.
- A core concept is shared responsibility, where all individuals contribute to lowering risk and maintaining security.

## Communication and Network Security

- This domain is dedicated to managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications.
- It addresses vulnerabilities that can arise from insecure connections, especially for remote employees, and emphasizes organizational measures to discourage insecure behavior.
