## This lecture covers the last four domains of IT security: identity and access management, security assessment and testing, security operations, and software development security.

## Identity and Access Management (IAM)

- IAM focuses on controlling access and authorization to keep data secure by ensuring users follow established policies.
- Key components include identification (verifying who a user is), authentication (proving identity), authorization (determining access level), and accountability (monitoring user actions).

## Security Assessment and Testing

- This domain involves conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and performing security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.
- Regular testing and data analysis help identify new ways to mitigate threats and improve existing security controls.

## Security Operations

- Security operations focus on conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures after a security incident has been identified.
- This includes mitigating active attacks, conducting forensic investigations to understand the breach, and determining areas for improvement to prevent future attacks.

## Software Development Security

- This domain emphasizes using secure coding practices throughout the software development lifecycle.
- Integrating security reviews at each phase, such as secure design reviews and penetration testing, ensures that security is embedded into the software product from the start.
