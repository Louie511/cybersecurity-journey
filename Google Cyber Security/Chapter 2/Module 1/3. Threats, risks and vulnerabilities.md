## This lecture explains the key concepts of threats, risks, and vulnerabilities in the context of cybersecurity and asset management. 

## Understanding Assets and Their Exposure

- An asset is anything of value to an organization, including physical spaces, computers, customer data, and intellectual property.
- Organizations face various security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities that can negatively impact these assets.

## Threats and Risks

- A threat is any event or circumstance that can harm assets, such as social engineering attacks like phishing, which exploit human error to gain sensitive information.
- A risk is the likelihood of a threat occurring and impacting the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset. Risks are often rated as low, medium, or high based on potential damage.
