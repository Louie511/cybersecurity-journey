## This lecture discusses ransomware, its impact on organizations, and the three layers of the web.

## Ransomware and the Web

- Ransomware is a malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment for its restoration.
- The web consists of three layers: the surface web (publicly accessible), the deep web (requires authorization), and the dark web (requires special software and is often associated with criminal activity).

## Impacts of Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities

### Financial Impact: 
- Attacks can lead to interrupted production, correction costs, and fines due to non-compliance.

### Identity Theft: 
- Storing sensitive data like Personally Identifiable Information (PII) creates a risk of it being sold or leaked, often through the dark web.

### Damage to Reputation: 
- Exploited vulnerabilities can cause customers to seek competitors and result in negative publicity, legal penalties, and fines.
