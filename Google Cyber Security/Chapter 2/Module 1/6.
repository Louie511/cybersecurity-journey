## This lecture explores how organizations manage risk and the common tactics used by threat actors to help you prepare for a career in cybersecurity.

## Risk Management Strategies

- Organizations protect valuable assets, which can be digital (like personal information) or physical (like servers).
- Common strategies for managing risks include acceptance, avoidance, transference, and mitigation.

## Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities

- Threats are events that can negatively impact assets, such as insider threats or advanced persistent threats.
- Risks are anything that can affect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset, including external, internal, legacy system, multiparty, and software compliance risks.

## Understanding Vulnerabilities

- Vulnerabilities are weaknesses that can be exploited by threats, such as ProxyLogon, ZeroLogon, Log4Shell, and PetitPotam.
- As a security analyst, you might work in vulnerability management, which involves monitoring systems to identify and mitigate these weaknesses through patching and updates.
