## This lecture explains how security frameworks help organizations protect against various threats and vulnerabilities.

## Understanding Security Frameworks

- Security frameworks are guidelines used to build plans for mitigating risks and threats to data and privacy.
- They address both virtual and physical security, including measures like key card access for buildings.

## Protecting Against Social Engineering

- Frameworks provide guidance on preventing, detecting, and responding to security breaches, especially social engineering attacks like phishing.
- Since people are often the biggest security threat, frameworks help create plans to increase employee awareness and educate them on protecting the organization.

## The Role of Employee Education

- Educating employees about existing security challenges is crucial for minimizing breaches.
- Training employees to recognize potential threats and having plans for quick reporting and addressing security issues are essential.
