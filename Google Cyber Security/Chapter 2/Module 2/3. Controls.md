## This lecture explains explains how security controls are used to reduce specific security risks within an organization.

## Understanding Security Controls

- Security controls are safeguards designed to minimize specific security risks, preventing potential financial and reputational damage.
- These controls are crucial for protecting against risks like unauthorized access, fake accounts, or fraudulent benefits.

## Types of Security Controls

### Encryption: 
- This process converts readable data into an encoded format (ciphertext) to ensure confidentiality, making sensitive information unreadable until decrypted.

### Authentication: 
- This verifies the identity of a user or system, ranging from basic username/password logins to advanced multi-factor authentication (MFA) using biometrics.

## Authorization and the CIA Triad

### Authorization: 
- This grants specific permissions to access resources within a system, ensuring that only authorized individuals can view or use certain data.
- The security controls discussed, including encryption, authentication, and authorization, are fundamental elements of the CIA triad, a core security model.
