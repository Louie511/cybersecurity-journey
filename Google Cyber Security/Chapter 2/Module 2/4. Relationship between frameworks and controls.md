## This lecture explores how security frameworks and controls are used together to mitigate organizational risk and ensure compliance with regulations.

## Security Frameworks and Controls

- Security frameworks are guidelines for building plans to mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy, helping organizations adhere to compliance laws.
- Security controls are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks, acting as measures to lower threats to data and privacy.

## Specific Frameworks

- The Cyber Threat Framework (CTF) provides a common language for describing and communicating cyber threat activity, aiding cybersecurity professionals in analysis and information sharing.
- ISO/IEC 27001 is an internationally recognized framework that outlines requirements for an information security management system and best practices for managing asset security.

## Types of Controls

- Controls can be physical (e.g., gates, security guards), technical (e.g., firewalls, MFA), or administrative (e.g., separation of duties, authorization).
- These controls are typically used to prevent, detect, or correct security issues, working alongside frameworks to reduce the possibility and impact of security threats.
