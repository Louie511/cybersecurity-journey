## This lecture introduces the CIA triad, a core security model that helps protect an organization's sensitive assets and data.

## Confidentiality

- Ensures that only authorized users can access specific assets or data.
- Sensitive data should be available on a "need to know" basis.

## Integrity

- Means that data is correct, authentic, and reliable.
- Helps security professionals determine if data can be trusted.

## Availability

- Ensures that data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it.
- Inaccessible data is not useful and can prevent people from doing their jobs.
