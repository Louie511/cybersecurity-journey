## This lecture focuses on the six core functions of the NIST CSF framework, which are essential for managing cybersecurity risks and ensuring organizational protection.

## NIST CSF's Six Core Functions

- ## Govern:
- This function emphasizes the importance of strong cybersecurity governance across all levels of the organization. It's about establishing and maintaining the structures and processes needed to effectively manage cybersecurity risk. This includes things like setting clear cybersecurity objectives, ensuring leadership commitment, developing and implementing a comprehensive risk management strategy, and continuously improving cybersecurity performance.

- ## Identify:
- This function involves managing cybersecurity risk and its impact on an organization's people and assets, such as monitoring systems for potential security issues.

- ## Protect:
- This function focuses on implementing strategies like policies, procedures, training, and tools to mitigate cybersecurity threats.

## Detecting and Responding to Incidents

- ## Detect:
- This function aims to identify potential security incidents and improve monitoring capabilities to increase detection speed and efficiency.

- ## Respond:
- This function ensures that proper procedures are used to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents, and to implement improvements to the security process.


## Recovering from Incidents

- ## Recover:
- This function involves the process of returning affected systems back to normal operation after an incident, including restoring data and assets.

- All six functions are crucial for establishing effective security strategies, enabling organizations to quickly recover from damage and minimize risk.
