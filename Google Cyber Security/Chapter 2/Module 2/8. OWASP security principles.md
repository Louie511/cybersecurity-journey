## This lecture explains key OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) security principles that are important for security analysts to understand.

## Minimizing Attack Surface and Least Privilege

- ### Minimize Attack Surface Area:
 This involves reducing potential vulnerabilities that threat actors could exploit by disabling unnecessary software features, restricting access, and implementing stronger password requirements.

- ### Principle of Least Privilege:
 Users should only have the minimum access necessary to perform their tasks, which limits the damage a security breach can cause.

## Defense in Depth and Separation of Duties

- ### Defense in Depth:
 Organizations should implement multiple security controls, such as multi-factor authentication, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems, to create several layers of defense.

- ### Separation of Duties:
 This principle prevents individuals from having too many privileges that could lead to fraudulent activities, ensuring that no single person can misuse the system.

## Keeping Security Simple and Fixing Issues Correctly

- ### Keep Security Simple:
 Avoid overly complex security solutions that can become unmanageable and hinder collaboration among security teams.

- ### Fix Security Issues Correctly:
 When incidents occur, identify the root cause, correct vulnerabilities, and conduct tests to ensure successful repairs.
