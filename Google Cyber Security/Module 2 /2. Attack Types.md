## Types of Cyberattacks

### Password attacks: 
- These involve attempts to gain unauthorized access to devices, systems, networks, or data by cracking passwords, often using methods like brute force or rainbow tables. These attacks fall under the communication and network security domain.

### Social engineering attacks: 
- These attacks manipulate human error to obtain private information or access, including phishing, smishing, vishing, and whaling. They are related to the security and risk management domain.
Physical and Advanced Attacks

### Physical attacks: 
- These incidents affect both digital and physical environments, such as malicious USB cables or flash drives, and card cloning. They are categorized under the asset security domain.

### Adversarial artificial intelligence: 
- This technique manipulates AI and machine learning to conduct more efficient attacks, falling under both communication and network security and identity and access management domains.

### Supply-Chain and Cryptographic Attacks

- Supply-chain attacks: These target vulnerabilities in systems, applications, hardware, or software within a supply chain to deploy malware, potentially affecting multiple organizations. They can fall under several domains, including security and risk management, security architecture and engineering, and security operations.
- Cryptographic attacks: These compromise secure communication between parties, with examples like birthday, collision, and downgrade attacks. They are part of the communication and network security domain.
