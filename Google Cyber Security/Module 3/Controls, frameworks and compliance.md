## This lecture explores how security frameworks, controls, and compliance regulations work together to manage security and minimize risk within organizations.

### The Relationship Between Controls, Frameworks, and Compliance

- The Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) triad guides organizations in assessing risk for systems and security policies.
- Security controls are safeguards that reduce specific risks, working with frameworks to implement security goals and meet compliance.

## Key Frameworks and Regulations

- The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides voluntary compliance frameworks like the Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and Risk Management Framework (RMF) to help manage risk.
- The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an E.U. regulation protecting residents' data privacy, requiring transparency and breach notification.

## Industry-Specific Standards

- The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission - North American Electric Reliability Corporation (FERC-NERC) regulates organizations involved with the U.S. and North American power grid, requiring them to mitigate and report security incidents.
- The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a U.S. federal law protecting patient health information, with rules on privacy, security, and breach notification.
