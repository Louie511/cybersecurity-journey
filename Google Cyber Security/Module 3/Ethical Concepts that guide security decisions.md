## This lecture focuses on security ethics, particularly regarding counterattacks and the ethical obligations of cybersecurity professionals.



## Ethical Concerns and Laws Related to Counterattacks

- In the U.S., counterattacking a threat actor is illegal due to laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, as it's seen as vigilantism and can escalate attacks.
- Internationally, counterattacks are permissible under strict conditions, such as only affecting the initial attacker, not escalating the situation, and having reversible effects, though these are difficult to measure.

## Ethical Principles and Methodologies

- Cybersecurity relies on frameworks like the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) triad to address confidentiality, privacy, and legal issues, as counterattacks are generally disapproved of or illegal.
- Professionals have an ethical duty to protect private information, identify vulnerabilities, manage risks, and align security with business goals, especially concerning Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (SPII).

## Ethical Obligations of Cybersecurity Professionals

- Cybersecurity professionals must remain unbiased, honest, and responsible, adhering to laws and relying on evidence to protect organizations and their infrastructure.
- Staying informed and continuously advancing skills is crucial for ethically addressing issues and contributing to the improvement of the cyber landscape, as exemplified by laws like HIPAA.
