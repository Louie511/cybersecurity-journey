## Security Frameworks

- Security frameworks are guidelines for building plans to mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy, providing a structured approach to implementing a security lifecycle.
- Their purpose includes protecting personally identifiable information (PII), securing financial information, identifying security weaknesses, managing organizational risks, and aligning security with business goals.

## Core Components of Security Frameworks

- The first component involves identifying and documenting security goals, such as aligning with regulations like GDPR.
- The second component focuses on setting guidelines to achieve these goals, which might involve developing new policies for handling data requests.

## Implementing and Monitoring Security

- The third component is implementing strong security processes, like designing procedures for a social media company to comply with user data requests.
- The final component involves monitoring and communicating results, such as reporting potential security issues to management or compliance officers.
