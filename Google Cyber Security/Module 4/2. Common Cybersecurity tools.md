## This lecture explains how security tools help entry-level security analysts mitigate risks and threats by organizing and analyzing log data.

## Understanding Logs and SIEM Tools

### Logs as Data Sources: 
- Logs are essential records of events within an organization's systems, such as employee sign-ins or web service access, which help identify vulnerabilities and breaches.
  
### SIEM Tools for Analysis: 
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools collect and analyze log data in real-time, enabling security analysts to quickly identify and respond to potential security threats.

## Common SIEM Tools and Their Functions

### Splunk: 
- Splunk Enterprise is a self-hosted data analysis platform that provides SIEM solutions for retaining, analyzing, and searching an organization's log data.

### Google Chronicle: 
- Chronicle is a cloud-native SIEM tool designed for fast delivery of new features, storing security data for search and analysis in the cloud.

## Other Key Security Tools

### Playbooks: 
- These manuals provide detailed instructions for operational actions, guiding analysts on how to handle security incidents before, during, and after they occur.

### Network Protocol Analyzers: 
- Also known as packet sniffers (e.g., tcpdump, Wireshark), these tools capture and analyze data traffic within a network to help identify risks.
