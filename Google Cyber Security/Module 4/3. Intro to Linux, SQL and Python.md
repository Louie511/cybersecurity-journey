## This lecture introduces essential programming languages and operating systems used by cybersecurity analysts to manage, monitor, and analyze security threats.

## The Role of Programming in Cybersecurity

- Programming allows organizations to create specific instructions for computers, enabling accurate and efficient execution of tasks.
- It helps automate repetitive processes, reducing human error and saving significant time compared to manual work.

## Linux Operating System

- Linux is an open-source operating system that primarily uses a command-line interface, unlike macOS or Windows.
- Security analysts often use Linux to examine logs and investigate system activities, such as reviewing error logs during unusual network traffic.

## SQL and Python Programming Languages

- SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to create, interact with, and retrieve specific information from large databases.
- Python is utilized by security professionals for repetitive, time-consuming tasks that require high accuracy and detail.
