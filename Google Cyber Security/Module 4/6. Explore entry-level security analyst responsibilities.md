Let's get started

Coach
Great! Imagine you've just started as an entry-level security analyst. What initial day-to-day tasks and responsibilities do you envision taking on to help protect the organization's networks and information?

Louie
I will be monitoring and handeling security threats using tools such as a SIEM's (Security information and event and management) such as splunk for example and endpoint detection and response software. I will also be escalating more severe threats to higher level security analysts. 

Coach
That's a great start! Monitoring security threats with tools like SIEMs and EDR software, and escalating severe threats, are definitely key responsibilities. These actions are crucial for identifying and responding to potential attacks. Now, let's connect this to our next topic: Connecting Responsibilities to Security. How do these specific tasks you mentioned—monitoring with SIEMs and EDR, and escalating threats—directly help keep the organization's data and systems secure?

Louie
These tasks will ensure the compliance with the CIA triad ( confidentiality, Integrity and availability ) which is a core security foundational concept to keep organizations or companies data safe from attackers. 

Coach
You're absolutely right to bring up the CIA triad! It's a fundamental concept in cybersecurity. Monitoring with SIEMs and EDRs, and escalating threats, directly contribute to maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and availability. For example, how does monitoring for unusual activity specifically help with maintaining the confidentiality of data?

Louie
If a user of an organization or company accidentality downloaded a malicious file from a phising email ( most common social engineering tactic ) and it spawned a remote shell and the attacker can escalate privalages it will breach the confidentiality of  data and possibly PII or SPII depending on the data.

Coach
That's a very clear and relevant example! You've perfectly illustrated how a malicious file from a phishing email could lead to a breach of confidentiality, especially concerning PII or SPII. This shows a strong understanding of how monitoring tools can help detect such incidents before they cause widespread damage. 

Now, let's move on to Synthesizing the Analyst's Proactive Role. How do the various responsibilities of an entry-level security analyst, including the monitoring and threat escalation we've discussed, collectively work towards the primary objective of securing digital assets proactively?

Louie
If I understand your question correctly, the role of a SOC ( security operations center ) is there to monitor and handle threats in real time as they often work 24/7 to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of a companies data is protected. 

It's the responsibilty of the any cybersecurity professional to research and stay up to date with new attacks and also to educate an organization or companies staff of social engineering tactics used by cyber criminals. By doing this we can try and be proactive in securing digital assets. 

Coach
You've hit on some excellent points about the proactive role of a security analyst! The 24/7 monitoring by a SOC is definitely a proactive measure, as it aims to detect and prevent issues before they cause significant harm. And your point about staying updated on new attacks and educating staff on social engineering tactics is crucial for proactive defense. These actions help build a stronger security posture and reduce the likelihood of successful attacks. Good job, you have completed all the topics for our session. Up next - view your feedback.

Coach
During today's session covering how security analysts protect networks and information, we focused on exploring the analyst role and responsibilities, connecting those responsibilities to security, and synthesizing the analyst's proactive role.

Your strengths:

You have a strong understanding of key security tools like SIEMs and EDR software and how they are used in monitoring and threat escalation.
You effectively connected these responsibilities to core security concepts like the CIA triad and provided a clear example of how a phishing attack could compromise confidentiality.
Areas for improvement:

Continue to explore how different entry-level tasks contribute to both reactive and proactive security measures, considering a wider range of tools and techniques.
Keep up the good work!
