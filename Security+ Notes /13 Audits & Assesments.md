# Audits and Assessments (Security+ Objective 5.5)

## Internal Audits & Assessments
- **Internal Audits**: Conducted by the organization’s own audit team.  
  - Evaluate internal controls, compliance, and data integrity.  
  - Process: review policies, test controls, document findings, recommend improvements.  
  - Tied to compliance requirements and overseen by an Audit Committee.  

- **Internal Assessments**: Proactive evaluation of security posture.  
  - Types: self-assessments, vulnerability assessments, threat modeling, risk assessments.  
  - Identify risks, likelihood, and impact → recommend mitigations (code fixes, controls, architecture changes).  
  - Use checklists (e.g., MCIT Cybersecurity Self-Assessment) with collaborative input across teams.

## External Audits & Assessments
- **External Audits**: Performed by independent third parties.  
  - Provide an unbiased view of security posture.  
  - Validate compliance with frameworks/regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS).  

- **External Assessments**: Independent analysis of vulnerabilities and risks.  
  - Include risk, vulnerability, and threat assessments.  
  - Require documented evidence of compliance.  
  - Support regulatory requirements and build trust with stakeholders.

## Penetration Testing
- Simulated cyberattacks to identify exploitable weaknesses.  
- **Types**:  
  - *Physical* → test locks, cameras, access cards.  
  - *Red Team* (offensive) → exploit vulnerabilities.  
  - *Blue Team* (defensive) → detect/respond.  
  - *Purple Team* (integrated) → red + blue collaboration.  
- Reconnaissance:  
  - Active (direct scanning, e.g., Nmap).  
  - Passive (OSINT, WHOIS).  
- Environments: known, partially known, unknown.  
- Tools: e.g., **Metasploit** for exploit testing.

## Attestation of Findings
- Formal validation that an audit, assessment, or pentest occurred.  
- Provides evidence of vulnerabilities and compliance checks.  
- Required by regulations (GLBA, HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOX).  
- Types: software, hardware, and system attestation.  
- Builds trust, accountability, and transparency for stakeholders.
