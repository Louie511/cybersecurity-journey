# Cyber Resilience and Redundancy
**Objective 3.4: Explain the importance of resilience and recovery in security architecture**

---

## High Availability
- **Goal:** Keep services continuously available with minimal downtime.
- **Methods:** Load balancing, clustering, redundancy, multi-cloud strategies.

### Uptime & Availability
- **Uptime:** Percentage of time a system is online.
- **Five Nines (99.999%):** ~5 minutes downtime/year.
- **Six Nines (99.9999%):** ~31 seconds downtime/year.

### Load Balancing
- Distributes workloads across multiple resources.
- Optimizes resource usage, throughput, and response time.
- Prevents overload of a single resource.

### Clustering
- Uses multiple computers, storage devices, and network connections as one system.
- Increases availability, reliability, and scalability.
- Ensures continuity during hardware failures.
- Can be combined with load balancing.

### Redundancy
- Duplicate critical components to prevent single points of failure.
- Examples: Power supplies, network connections, servers, software services, service providers.

### Multi-Cloud Approach
- Spread data/apps across multiple cloud providers.
- Reduces risk of provider-specific failure and vendor lock-in.
- Requires unified data/threat management and policy enforcement.

## Data Redundancy (RAID Overview)
- **RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks):** Combines multiple disks into one logical storage unit.

### RAID Levels
- **RAID 0:** Striping, high performance, no redundancy.
- **RAID 1:** Mirroring, full redundancy, survives 1 disk failure.
- **RAID 5:** Striping + parity, tolerates 1 disk failure, slower rebuild.
- **RAID 6:** Like RAID 5 with double parity, tolerates 2 disk failures.
- **RAID 10:** RAID 1 + RAID 0, high performance + redundancy, requires 4+ disks.

### RAID Resilience Categories
- **Failure-resistant:** Handles hardware malfunctions (e.g., RAID 1).
- **Fault-tolerant:** Allows continued operation + quick rebuilds (e.g., RAID 5/6/10).
- **Disaster-tolerant:** Survives major events with separate zones (e.g., RAID 1/10).

---

## Capacity Planning
- Ensures future demand can be met cost-effectively.

### Four Main Aspects
1. **People:** Skill assessment, hiring, training (e.g., seasonal employees).
2. **Technology:** Evaluate/scaling of tech resources (e.g., e-commerce spikes).
3. **Infrastructure:** Space/power planning (e.g., data centers).
4. **Processes:** Workflow optimization, automation, outsourcing.

## Powering Data Centers
### Power Events
- **Surges:** Small voltage increases.
- **Spikes:** Short, sharp increases.
- **Sags:** Brief decreases.
- **Brownouts:** Prolonged undervoltage.
- **Blackouts:** Complete power loss.

### Protection Components
- **Line Conditioners:** Stabilize/filter voltage.
- **UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply):** Battery backup, line conditioning, 15–60 mins runtime.
- **Generators:** Long-term power during outages (portable/permanent/battery-inverter).
- **PDC (Power Distribution Centers):** Centralized power distribution, circuit protection, load balancing.

---

## Data Backups
- **Goal:** Protect data against loss, corruption, unavailability.
- **Onsite vs Offsite:** Onsite = convenient but disaster-prone; Offsite = disaster protection.

### Backup Frequency
- Based on **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** Defines acceptable data loss window.

### Encryption
- Protects backup data from unauthorized access.
- **At rest:** Data encrypted in storage.
- **In transit:** Data encrypted during transfer.

### Snapshots
- Point-in-time copies.
- Stores only changes since last snapshot → storage efficient.

### Recovery
- Steps: Select backup → initiate recovery → validate data → test/verify → document.
- **Replication:** Real-time/near-real-time copies for continuity.
- **Journaling:** Record changes for granular recovery + compliance.

---

## Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP)
- Ensures recovery from disruptions/disasters.

### Key Terms
- **BCP (Business Continuity Plan):** Preventative + recovery measures for disruptions.
- **DRP (Disaster Recovery Plan):** Subset of BCP, focused on fast recovery from disasters.

### Strategies
- Alternative locations for infrastructure.
- Staff distribution across regions.
- Cloud services for resilience.

### Roles
- **Senior Management:** Sets goals, approves scope, appoints coordinators.
- **Business Continuity Committee:** Cross-department reps, set recovery priorities.

---

## Redundant Site Considerations
- **Hot Sites:** Fully ready, instant switchover (expensive).
- **Warm Sites:** Partially ready, operational in days.
- **Cold Sites:** Minimal setup, operational in weeks/months (cheap).
- **Mobile Sites:** Portable hot/warm/cold (e.g., military units).

### Virtual Sites
- Cloud-based redundancy.
- **Virtual Hot/Warm/Cold Sites** scale resources as needed.
- Cost-effective, scalable, easy to maintain.

### Geographic Dispersion
- Spread resources across multiple regions.
- Increases disaster recovery and redundancy.

---

## Testing Resilience & Recovery
- **Resilience Testing:** Tabletop exercises, failover tests, simulations, parallel processing.
- **Recovery Testing:** Executes actual recovery procedures to ensure effectiveness.

### Test Types
- **Tabletop Exercises:** Discussion-based, identifies plan weaknesses.
- **Failover Tests:** Switch to backups, validate process.
- **Simulations:** Virtual scenario, hands-on staff evaluation.
- **Parallel Processing:** Run main + backup simultaneously, test multi-failure resilience.
