# Cyber Resilience and Redundancy
##Objective 3.4: Explain the importance of resilience and recovery in security architecture**

---

## High Availability
  - Goal: Keep services continuously available with minimal downtime.  
  - Methods: Load balancing, clustering, redundancy, multi-cloud strategies.  

### Uptime & Availability
- **Uptime:** Percentage of time a system is online.  
- **Five Nines (99.999%):** ~5 minutes downtime per year.  
- **Six Nines (99.9999%):** ~31 seconds downtime per year.  

### Load Balancing
- Distributes workloads across multiple servers.  
- Optimizes resource usage, throughput, and response time.  
- Prevents overload of any single system.  

### Clustering
- Multiple servers/storage/network act as a single system.  
- Provides high availability, reliability, and scalability.  
- Continues service during hardware failures.  

### Redundancy
- Duplicate critical components to eliminate single points of failure.  
- Examples: Power supplies, network links, servers, software services, service providers.  

### Multi-Cloud Approach
- Spreads data/apps across different cloud providers.  
- Reduces risk of provider-specific failures and vendor lock-in.  
- Requires unified data/threat management and consistent policy enforcement.

## Data Redundancy (RAID)
**RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks):** Combines multiple drives into one logical storage unit.  

### RAID Levels
- **RAID 0 (Striping):** High performance, no redundancy.  
- **RAID 1 (Mirroring):** Full redundancy, survives 1 drive failure.  
- **RAID 5 (Striping + Parity):** Fault tolerance, 1 drive can fail, slower rebuilds.  
- **RAID 6 (Double Parity):** Fault tolerance, 2 drives can fail.  
- **RAID 10 (Mirroring + Striping):** High performance + redundancy, requires 4+ drives.  

### RAID Resilience
- **Failure-resistant:** Resists hardware issues (RAID 1).  
- **Fault-tolerant:** Continues operations + quick rebuilds (RAID 5/6/10).  
- **Disaster-tolerant:** Protects against major events via separate zones (RAID 1/10).  

---

## Capacity Planning
- Ensures organizations meet future demand cost-effectively.  

### Key Areas
- **People:** Skills, hiring, training, scaling workforce.  
- **Technology:** Assess/scaling resources, future investment.  
- **Infrastructure:** Space, utilities, data center capacity.  
- **Processes:** Workflow optimization, automation, outsourcing.  

---

## Powering Data Centers
### Power Events
- **Surges:** Small voltage increases.  
- **Spikes:** Short, sharp increases (e.g., lightning).  
- **Sags:** Brief decreases in voltage.  
- **Brownouts:** Prolonged undervoltage.  
- **Blackouts:** Complete loss of power.  

### Protection Components
- **Line Conditioners:** Stabilize/filter voltage.  
- **UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply):** Battery backup (15–60 mins), line conditioning.  
- **Generators:** Long-term power, portable or permanent.  
- **PDC (Power Distribution Center):** Centralized distribution, circuit protection, load balancing.  

---

## Data Backups
- Protect against data loss, corruption, or unavailability.  

### Onsite vs Offsite
- **Onsite:** Convenient, but vulnerable to disasters.  
- **Offsite:** Safer for disaster recovery.  

### Backup Frequency
- Defined by **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** How much data loss is acceptable.  

### Encryption
- **At Rest:** Protects stored data.  
- **In Transit:** Protects data during transfer.  

### Snapshots
- Point-in-time copies.  
- Records only changes since last snapshot → storage efficient.  

### Recovery
- Steps: Select backup → recover → validate → test → document.  
- **Replication:** Real-time/near-real-time copying.  
- **Journaling:** Tracks changes for granular recovery + compliance.  

---

## Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP)
- Ensures recovery from disruptive events/disasters.  

### Plans
- **Business Continuity Plan (BCP):** Broad preventative + recovery measures.  
- **Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP):** Subset of BCP, focused on rapid disaster recovery.  

### Strategies
- Alternative locations for infrastructure.  
- Distribute staff across regions.  
- Use cloud services to maintain operations.  

### Roles
- **Senior Management:** Defines scope, goals, risk appetite.  
- **Business Continuity Committee:** Cross-department team, sets priorities.  

---

## Redundant Sites
### Types
- **Hot Site:** Fully operational, instant switchover (expensive).  
- **Warm Site:** Partial setup, operational in days.  
- **Cold Site:** Minimal setup, operational in weeks/months (cheap).  
- **Mobile Site:** Portable hot/warm/cold options (e.g., military).  

### Virtual Sites
- Cloud-based redundancy.  
- **Virtual Hot Site:** Fully replicated, instant access.  
- **Virtual Warm Site:** Scales resources when needed.  
- **Virtual Cold Site:** Minimal ongoing costs, activated only in disasters.  

### Geographic Dispersion
- Spreads resources across locations.  
- Reduces risk of localized outages.  
- Improves disaster recovery.

## Testing Resilience & Recovery
### Resilience Testing
- Ensures systems can withstand and adapt to disruptions.  
- Methods: Tabletop exercises, failover tests, simulations, parallel processing.  

### Recovery Testing
- Validates the ability to restore operations after disruptions.  
- Involves executing planned recovery procedures.  

### Test Types
- **Tabletop Exercises:** Scenario discussions, identify gaps, low-cost.  
- **Failover Tests:** Switch to backups, validate disaster recovery.  
- **Simulations:** Virtual real-world scenarios, test staff performance.  
- **Parallel Processing:** Run primary + backup together, test multi-failure resilience.
