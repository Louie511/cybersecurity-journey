# Security Architecture Overview

## 1. Security Architecture Models
- **Centralized Architecture:** Single control point, efficient resource management, consistent data, cost-effective; risks include single point of failure and scalability issues.  
- **Decentralized Architecture:** Distributed systems, resilient, scalable, flexible; risks include data inconsistency, security threats, and complex management.

## 2. Computing Environments
### On-Premise
- Infrastructure hosted locally.  
- **Pros:** Control, security, regulatory compliance.  
- **Cons:** Higher cost, maintenance challenges.

### Cloud Computing
- Delivery of computing services via the internet (servers, storage, databases, networking).  
- **Advantages:** Fast innovation, flexible resources, economies of scale.  
- **Key Considerations:** Availability, resilience, cost, responsiveness, scalability, deployment ease, patching, risk transference, compute resources.  
- **Shared Responsibility:** Customers are responsible for data security; providers handle infrastructure, updates, and power.

### Hybrid Solutions
- Combination of on-premise, private, and public cloud.  
- **Pros:** Flexibility and control.  
- **Considerations:** Security, compliance, interoperability, cost.

## 3. Cloud Security
- **Risks:** Shared server vulnerabilities, weak access management, single points of failure, outdated measures, weak encryption, data remnants.  
- **Mitigations:** Multi-factor authentication, strong encryption, secure VM/container management, policy clarity, redundancy, regular updates, secure data deletion.  
- **Virtualization & Containerization:**  
  - **Virtual Machines (VMs):** Emulate servers, isolate OS environments.  
  - **Containers:** Lightweight, portable, scalable (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).  
  - **Hypervisors:** Type 1 (bare-metal), Type 2 (hosted).  
  - **VM Security:** Patching, isolation, encryption, monitoring.

## 4. Serverless & Microservices
- **Serverless:** Provider manages servers; developers focus on functions.  
  - **Benefits:** Cost-efficient, auto-scaling, faster development.  
  - **Risks:** Vendor lock-in, evolving best practices.  
- **Microservices:** Break applications into small, independent services.  
  - **Pros:** Scalable, resilient, flexible, faster deployment.  
  - **Challenges:** Complexity, data management, network latency, security.

## 5. Network Infrastructure
- **Physical Separation (Air-Gapping):** High security, isolated from networks.  
- **Logical Separation:** Uses firewalls, VLANs; flexible but less secure if misconfigured.  
- **Software-Defined Networking (SDN):** Centralized, programmable network management; improves efficiency and monitoring.  
  - **Planes:** Data Plane, Control Plane, Application Plane.

## 6. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Automates infrastructure provisioning using code (YAML, JSON, HCL).  
- **Benefits:** Speed, consistency, scalability, cost savings, auditability.  
- **Challenges:** Learning curve, complexity, security risks (modularization and documentation mitigate risks).

## 7. Internet of Things (IoT)
- Network of physical devices with sensors, software, and connectivity.  
- **Components:** Hub/control system, smart devices, wearables, sensors.  
- **Risks:** Weak defaults, poorly configured services.  

## 8. Industrial and Embedded Systems
- **ICS & SCADA:** Control industrial processes (electricity, water, oil/gas).  
  - **Risks:** Unauthorized access, malware, outdated systems, physical threats.  
  - **Security Measures:** Access control, patching, firewalls, audits, employee training.  
- **Embedded Systems:** Specialized computing for dedicated functions.  
  - **RTOS:** For real-time applications.  
  - **Security Strategies:** Network segmentation, firmware control, OTA updates.
