## Active Directory Basics (TryHackMe)

I completed the **Active Directory Basics** lab on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/), which introduces the fundamentals of how Active Directory (AD) environments are structured and managed.  

### Key Topics Covered
- **What is Active Directory?**  
  Understanding AD as Microsoftâ€™s directory service for centralized identity and access management.  

- **Domain Controllers (DCs):**  
  Servers responsible for authentication, authorization, and enforcing security policies.  

- **Forest, Trees, and Domains:**  
  Hierarchical structure used to organize resources and users within an enterprise environment.  

- **Organizational Units (OUs):**  
  Logical containers for grouping users, groups, and devices for easier management.  

- **Users and Groups:**  
  - Domain Users and Administrators  
  - Security vs. Distribution groups  
  - Role-based access control concepts  

- **Group Policy Objects (GPOs):**  
  Mechanism for applying system settings, security rules, and configurations across the domain.  

- **Trust Relationships:**  
  Connections between domains that allow resource sharing and authentication.  

### Skills Practiced
- Navigating AD concepts and terminology.  
- Identifying how authentication and access control are managed in enterprise environments.  
- Building foundational knowledge required for security tasks like enumeration, privilege escalation, and defense in AD environments.
