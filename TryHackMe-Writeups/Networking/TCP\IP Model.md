## TCP/IP Model Summary

- *The TCP/IP model is a conceptual framework used for network communications, designed around the protocols of the Internet. It is simpler than the OSI model and consists of four layers, each responsible for specific networking functions.*

## Layers and Functions:
**1. Application Layer**
- *Provides network services directly to applications.*
- *Combines OSI’s Application, Presentation, and Session layers.*
- **Examples:** *HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, DNS, SMTP, IMAP.*

**2. Transport Layer**
- *Ensures data delivery between hosts.*
- *Provides reliability (TCP) or fast, connectionless communication (UDP).*
- **Examples:** *TCP, UDP.*

**3. Internet Layer**
- *Handles addressing and routing of packets across networks.*
- *Similar to OSI’s Network layer.*
- **Examples:** *IP (IPv4/IPv6), ICMP, ARP.*

**4. Network Access / Link Layer**
- *Responsible for delivering data over the physical network.*
- *Combines OSI’s Data Link and Physical layers.
- **Examples:** *Ethernet, Wi-Fi, switches, MAC addressing.*

## Key Points
- The TCP/IP model is practical and protocol-driven, unlike the conceptual OSI model.
- It forms the foundation of the Internet and most modern network communications.
- Focuses on end-to-end communication and interoperability.
